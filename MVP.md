# Info-Bar
Critical Information Bar For Supporting Media Literacy



<br><br>
The goal of this project is to provide crucial information for making decisions about the veracity of claims on the internet to the data consumer.



# Visualization

The hyperbole classifier will not be feasible for this project, as the datasets of tagged hyperboles and paraphrase sentences are currently not available for open use. Therefore, I am focusing on other dimensions that may help with media literacy. I am utilizing the fake news dataset from Kaggle to compare possible useful features before creating the infobar feature suite.


# Next Steps

I am working on developing a neural net classifier that can provide a fake news probability score for articles.
